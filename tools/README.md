Evaluation program for ESC2017
------------------------------

The ESC17_TEST.ST file is a structured text code that controls 2 LEDs connected to a Raspberry Pi 3, using OpenPLC. The code uses PWM modulation for the controlling the brightness of the 2 LEDs and emulates an attack where the duty cycle of the PWM is changed for one of the two LEDs.
